## Philosophy
- Panning for gold
- All output is cached and built on top of -- a sifting mechanism allowing the best to rise to the top

## Plan
- [X] Download & cache historical price data CSVs from Yahoo Finance and/or Alpha Vantage
- [X] Download entire Yahoo Finance stock price history database
  - [X] Identify 404 stocks
  - [X] Use a VPN just in case
- [X] Code a technical indicator (MACD) and verify it works
  - [X] Simulate automated MACD trading on entire stock history and analyze profits
  - [X] Repeat MACD for all 3000+ stocks and generate total return report
- [X] Rinse and repeat for **as many technical indicators as possible**
- [X] Write max-hold strategy
  - [X] Repeat max-hold strategy for all 3000+ stocks and generate report
- [X] Write reactive strategy
  - [X] Repeat reactive strategy for all 3000+ stocks and generate report
- [X] RSI
- [X] MACD-long
- [X] MACD-RSI
- [X] Multi-SMA
- [X] Naive ROI
- [X] AVG ROI + STDDEV
- [ ] ~~`argmax` for technical indicator parameters~~ -- no strategies were good enough to merit further exploration
- [ ] Reddit correlation
- [ ] Cluster analysis for most & least profitable stocks
- [ ] Tournament-style/survival of the fittest competition between determinstic trading strategies

## Na√Øve strategies

- [X] (reactive) Buy at the beginning of every rise, sell at the beginning of every dip
- Buy and hold N of the least expensive penny stocks
- Buy and hold the most profitable ETFs
- Buy and hold only the N most expensive stocks at all times
- Buy and sell N random stocks at random times
- Buy N stocks in the M sectors with the highest growth in the past Q time period

## Other variables to consider:

- Stock sector
- Diversification

## Future work
- Other exchanges

  - Currency/foreign exchange
  - Crypto
